# Advanced Macroeconomics Home Assignment

**The task was to describe business cycles in Cyprus (the country was assigned to me by the instructor), and to compare with business cycles in the USA that are analyzed on D. Williamson' Macroeconomics textbook (references are shared on the report file)**

Data is treated on Microsoft Excel.

Note: I made some changes before sharing, 
  1. I updated data and used different aggregates to calculate GDP components (for example, I replaced final total general government expenditures with final collective general government expenditures to measure government spendings, while I added the final individual general government expenditures to households and NPISH expenditures to measure consumption)
  2. I slightly modified the text to take the previous changes into consideration (Results did not significantly change)
