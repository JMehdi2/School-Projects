# Describing Business Cycles in Cyprus

**The object of this home assignment is to describe business cycles in Cyprus, while comparing them to those in the USA in light of D. Williamson's Macroeconomics textbook.**

Data is processed on Microsoft Excel.

Note: I made some modifications before sharing, 
  1. I updated data and used different aggregates to calculate GDP components (for example, I replaced final total general government expenditures with final collective general government expenditures to measure government spendings, while I added the final individual general government expenditures to households and NPISH expenditures to measure consumption)
  2. I slightly modified the text to take the previous changes into consideration. On the other hand, the analysis results did not significantly change.
