# Advanced Macroeconomics Home Assignment

**The task is to describe business cycles in Cyprus, and to compare with business cycles in the USA in light of D. Williamson' Macroeconomics textbook**

Data is processed on Microsoft Excel.

Note: I made some modifications before sharing, 
  1. I updated data and used different aggregates to calculate GDP components (for example, I replaced final total general government expenditures with final collective general government expenditures to measure government spendings, while I added the final individual general government expenditures to households and NPISH expenditures to measure consumption)
  2. I slightly modified the text to take the previous changes into consideration (Results did not significantly change)
